# Why?

Just to have something concrete to play and test qwik with

# What could it do?

Perhaps something like the following:

```

Main page
	- Countdown till next workshop

Browse topics
	- filter by theme, tag etc

Timeline
	- order topics by date, show past and future topics and mark the current moment in time


Suggest a topic
	- A simple form for new topics
	- list suggested topics
	- vote for topics (reddit / so style?)

```

## Where to get the data?

- Github api: 1 repository = 1 topic
- Admin pages / use a cms like strapi...?
- Build an admin panel?
